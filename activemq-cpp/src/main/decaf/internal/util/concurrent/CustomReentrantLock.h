             * Custom Reentrant Lock Implementation using std::mutex and Atomic
             * Ownership Tracking.
             *
             * This class provides Java-style monitor reentrancy without using
             * std::recursive_mutex. It manually tracks the owning thread ID and
             * recursion counter to enable the same thread to acquire the lock
             * multiple times without deadlocking.
             *
             * Key Features:
             * - Reentrant locking: Same thread can lock multiple times
             * - Condition variable support: fullyUnlock() and reLock() methods
             * - Thread-safe ownership tracking using atomics
             * - Compatible with std::condition_variable
             *
             * Usage with Condition Variables:
             * The fullyUnlock() and reLock() methods are critical for correct
             * condition variable behavior. When waiting on a condition
             * variable, the lock must be completely released (regardless of
             * recursion depth) and then restored to its previous state after
             * waking up.
             *
